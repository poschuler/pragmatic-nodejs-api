# Pragmatic Node.js API

A pragmatic foundation for building maintainable REST APIs with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

## ✨ Features

- **Scalable Architecture:** A modular, feature-based structure that grows with your project.
- **TypeScript by Default:** Enjoy the benefits of static typing for more robust and maintainable code.
- **Best Practices:** Built-in best practices for configuration management, routing, and more.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Comes with hot-reloading for a smooth development experience.
- **Linter & Formatter:** Integrated with BiomeJS for clean and consistent code.
- **Ready to Deploy:** Includes scripts for building and starting a production-ready server.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v24 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
